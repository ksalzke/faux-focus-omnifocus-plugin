This plugin was inspired by Ryan Murphy and his Applescript shared [here](https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/enabling-focus-on-ios-through-scripting-and-tags-and-seeking-suggestions-for-faster-execution/47302).

Note that it currently requires OmniFocus v3.4+ to run as it makes use of the `flattenedProjects` variable added in that version.
