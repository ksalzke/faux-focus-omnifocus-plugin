# About

This is an Omni Automation plug-in bundle for OmniFocus that mimics the built-in 'Focus' mode that is available on Mac. Further details are provided below.

This plugin was inspired by Ryan Murphy and his Applescript shared [here](https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/enabling-focus-on-ios-through-scripting-and-tags-and-seeking-suggestions-for-faster-execution/47302).

_Please note that all scripts on my GitHub account (or shared elsewhere) are works in progress. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions please let me know--and do please make sure you backup your database before running scripts from a random amateur on the internet!)_

# Installation & Set-Up

(For instructions on getting started with Omni Automation, see [here](https://kaitlinsalzke.com/how-to/how-to-add-a-omnijs-plug-in-to-omnifocus-and-assign-a-keyboard-shortcut/).)

1. Click on the green `Clone or download` button above to download a `.zip` file of all the files in this GitHub repository.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Open the file located at `Resources/focusConfig.js` and make any changes to the configuration needed to reflect your OmniFocus set-up. Further explanations of the options are included within that file as comments.
4. Rename the entire folder to anything you like, with the extension `.omnifocusjs`
5. Move the resulting file to your OmniFocus plug-in library folder.

# Actions

## Faux Focus

This action runs the `focus` function (see below) on one or more selected projects and/or folders.

## Faux Unfocus

This action can be run when the 'unfocused' tag is applied to one or more projects. It:
1. Makes each project that is tagged with `Unfocused` active.
2. Deletes the `Unfocused` tag.

# Functions

This plugin contains the following function within the `focusLib` library:

## focus

This function takes an array of projects and an array of folders as input. It:
1. Checks if there is already a 'focused' project and if so begins by running the 'Faux Unfocus' action.
2. For each active project that is not selected or inside a selected folder, applies an `Unfocused` tag (which can be configured in the configuration file) and marks the project as on hold.
3. When finished, an alert is shown to confirm that the script is completed.
